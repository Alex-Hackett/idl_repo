This directory contains modifcations by C. Markwardt of the FITS I/O routines
FXBCLOSE, FXHREAD, FXREAD, FXBREADM, and FXBWRITM to allow them to be used in
conjunction with his "seekable pipe" software available  available in
http://cow.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/io.html#FXGPKG.   These modifications
allow the FX* software to read gzip'ed files transparently under Unix.

fxgpkg.tar - the "seekable pipe" software, which is a duplicate of the tar
             file in http://cow.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/io.html#FXGPKG
fxbclose.pro, fxhread.pro, fxread.pro, fxbreadm.pro, fxbwritm.pro -- individual
             ASCII files 
fxb_filt.tar - a tar file containing the 5 individual procedures above

Revision History:

Prior to 21-Dec-1999, this directory contained "basic upgrades" to the FX* FITS
I/O package, which mainly concerned increased performance.   These upgrades are
now part of the standard IDL Astronomy Library distribution, and so are no
longer included in this directory.
