/landsman - Contains separate utilities in the /help, /v5  and /mousse 
            directories

   /help  Contains the procedure MAN.PRO and supporting procedures
           MAN.PRO will emulate the old IDL online help facility available
           prior to IDL version 4.0.   For example,

    IDL> man,'rebin      ;Display help on intrinisic IDL REBIN function
    IDL> man,'hrebin     ;Display help on Astronomy Library HREBIN procedure
    IDL> man,'astron     ;Display all astronomy library procedures

   1-Apr-96: Updated to work even if a ROUTINES.HELP file is not present
   19-Jul-96: Updated under VMS to work under VMS text libraries


    /mousse This is an old (1995) package designed for analyzing data from the
           Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT).     The full MOUSSE package is 
           available from http://archive.stsci.edu/uit/analysis.html.    The
           procedures here include only the subset of non-instrument specific
           software.
 
   
   /v5    Contains the procedure idlv4_to_v5 and associated procedures to
    change subscripts in a procedure from parentheses to square brackets for
    compatibility with IDL V5.0.    Also contains the reverse procedure
    idlv5_to_v4 to remove square brackets from an IDL V5.0 procedure, so that
    it runs under V4.0
