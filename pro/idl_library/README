The ACS IDL library is a collection of routines written to support the
ACS IDT Calibration effort.


Minimum requirements

    * IDL Astronomy Users library
    * IDL 5.4 or above

Installation

UNIX

    * Ensure you meet the minimum requirements.
    * Download the entire library.

    * Uncompress and extract the archive into your installation directory.

        % cd [install_dir]
        % gunzip -c acs_idl.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

    * Edit acs/bin/start_acs to customize for your site.

    * Download the following database files into the var subdirectory:
      acs_log.dbd,
      acs_log.dbh,
      acs_log.dbf,
      acs_log.dbx

    * Optionally add the bin subdirectory to your path.

The software may now be started by the bin/start_acs script.


Note: If you pulled the source only version you will have to build the pdecomp
executable in order to decompress compressed ACS frames.

    * Modify src/pdecomp/Makefile if necessary
    * Make the binary:
       % make
    * Install the binary somewhere in your IDL_PATH:
       % cp pdecomp ../../lib/acquisition
